# The-Gaming-Room-
Final project for CS 230; providing an outlined, and detailed, requirements for a company requested project as well as the coded project. 

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Gaming Room is a client requesting the development of their game, Win It or Lose It, for multi-platform use beynod the current Android only game app. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I identified an appropriate operating platform for expanding the app, operating system architectures, storage management system with the operating platform.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
This helped me understand the process of explaining/educating on the necessary requirements for a game to a company and how to appropriately implement practices on a production level. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would provide a deeper, or overall better, explanation on protection of user information, communication between platforms, and memory management techniques based on the chosen operating platform.
